                                <h4>1. You May Have to Redo All Your Content</h4>
                                <p>It is impossible to create effective content without taking SEO into consideration.
                                    If you create content without thinking about SEO, you may need to go back and redo
                                    all the new content you made for your website when you start your SEO strategy.
                                    There are a few reasons for this.</p>
                                <p>First, you‚Äôll be unsure as to what keyword terms you want to rank for. If you write
                                    content that doesn‚Äôt include appropriate keywords, it will be difficult to go back
                                    and include the terms naturally. Second, you may be unclear as to who makes up your
                                    target audience. The content you write for the wrong audience is useless and will
                                    need replacing.</p>

                                <h4>2. You May Have Technical Mistakes</h4>
                                <p>Technical mistakes may mean you require a site migration in the near future. This is
                                    a huge waste of time. Taking the technical side of SEO into account now will allow
                                    you to decide on</p>

                            <p>All the above assumes that a client is willing to create a website in the first place.
                                Some clients may believe that they can forgo a website entirely. However, without a
                                website, it is impossible for a business to grow. You need to explain why having an
                                SEO-optimized website is necessary for being found online. Of course, businesses can
                                find customers using other means, such as through social media, but these methods are
                                slower. Plus, users will still expect the business to have a website ‚Äî to obtain more
                                information about products, services, and the brand as a whole.</p>
