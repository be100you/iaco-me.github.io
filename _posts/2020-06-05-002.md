We all procrastinate... But how can we avoid that? 😱💤

In our lives there are things we want to do (because we like, or even love them ❤️), and things we have to do (because they are important, or mandatory ⚠️).

The 5 tips to help you avoiding procrastination, managing your time and getting things done:
- 00:00 | 💤 Hello World!
- 00:36 | ✅ Your System
- 01:31 | 📆 Calendar
- 04:56 | ⏰ Timers
- 07:42 | 🔀 Delegation

The idea is simple: to have more time and energy for the things that matter the most, it is important to have a system in place, a system that supports you!

- Your calendar reminds you about what you need to do;
- Your timers allow you to have control of your time and progress;
- By delegating you give tasks to those best suited for the job;
- Entering a Flow State allows you to be more focused and make better use of your time;
- And by paying attention to your health triangle you will have more energy and focus because your body and mind are working at their best capacity.
